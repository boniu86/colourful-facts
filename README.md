## Projects

In the [projects folder](https://github.com/thomasdebeus/colourful-facts/tree/develop/projects) you'll find the code behind the articles on [Colourful Facts](https://medium.com/tdebeus), a portfolio of my data journalism and Graphic reporting.

Code is written in R and Rmarkdown. End-results are always finalised in Sketch. You can find them on the [Colourful Facts blog](https://medium.com/tdebeus). At the beginning of my design journy I created visuals solely in Sketch and therefore do not appear in this repository. 

## Guides

I also keep a folder with ['guides'](https://github.com/thomasdebeus/colourful-facts/tree/master/guides). These guides can for example contain explantions of how to build perticular chart types. My goal is to always add a use case example when I am researching new graphic designs. I created this repository quite late in my data visualisation journey so you can say I'm a little behind. ðŸ˜‰
