## Projects

In this repository you'll find the code behind the projects on [Colourful Facts](https://medium.com/tdebeus), a portfolio of my data journalism, data visualisation and information design work.

Code is written in R and Rmarkdown. End results are always finalised in Sketch. Sometimes the visuals are entirely created in Sketch and therefore do not appear in this repository. 

## Guides

I also keep a folder with ['guides'](https://github.com/thomasdebeus/colourful-facts/tree/master/guides). These guides can for example contain explantions of how to build perticular chart types.
