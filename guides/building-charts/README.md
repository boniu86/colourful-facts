# Guides for building charts with R

In these folders you'll see examples where different charts in R are used for a certain analysis. Each chart has its own folder with the `.md` files as main report. There's also `meta-data.csv` about the data used in each report and you'll see that the plots are stored in a seperate folder. 

**Disclaimer**: the data or subjects don't really matter. It's just for practising the visualisation techniques and code within each chart vocabulary. These guides are mainly build as excersice in visualisation skills and to create my own resources.
